## 🔗 LangChain Overview

LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications with **LLMs** (Large Language Models). It helps chain together components like prompts, memory, tools, and agents to handle complex tasks.

### 🔍 LangChain Components Used:

| Component        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Document Loaders** | Load content from files like PDFs, TXT, URLs, etc.                        |
| **Text Splitters**   | Break large content into manageable chunks for processing                |
| **Embeddings**       | Convert text chunks into vector format for semantic search               |
| **Vector Stores**    | Store and retrieve embedded text (e.g., using FAISS, Chroma)             |
| **LLM Chains**       | Combine prompts with LLMs to generate structured outputs                 |
| **Retrieval QA**     | Ask questions about a document by retrieving and processing relevant text |
| **Memory**           | Maintain conversational state in the chat-based interface                |

LangChain enables dynamic and modular use of AI, ideal for building intelligent applications like Gen-AI-Notes.
